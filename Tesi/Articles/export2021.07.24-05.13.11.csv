The state of the art in interplanetary Internet,I. F. Akyildiz; O. B.

Interplanetary (IPN) Internet is expected to be the next step in the design and development of deep space networks as the Internet in the space. However, there are significant challenges to be addressed for the realization of this objective. This article captures the current state of the art and open research challenges, and intends to motivate researchers around the world to tackle these challenging problems and help realize the IPN Internet.",1558-1896,,10.1109/MCOM.2004.1316541,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316541,,Space technology;IP networks;Space missions;Space vehicles;Web and internet services;Protocols;Spine;Costs;Artificial satellites;Mars,space communication links;protocols,interplanetary Internet;deep space networks;scientific data delivery;navigational services,,36,,15,,26-Jul-04,,,IEEE,IEEE Magazines

Jackson,NA,IEEE Spectrum,01-Aug-05,2005,42,8,30,35,"This paper discusses the current debate among NASA engineers on how to best achieve a networked model of interplanetary communications.

The Sky is NOT the Limit Anymore: Future Architecture of the Interplanetary Internet,A. Alhilal; T. Braud; P. Hui,"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong; The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong; The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong",IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine,14-Aug-19,2019,34,8,22,32,"The ever-growing popularity of space exploration has attracted many organizations and private companies to attempt increasingly challenging missions. Each of these missions bring us one step closer to the colonization of the solar system. Many initiatives have been taken to aim at providing an architecture in the so-called interplanetary (IPN) Internet to serve these upcoming missions. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary, scalable, and extensible architecture that adapted the current IPN communication challenges and the milestones of future space exploration missions. This architecture provides the foundations for the communication and navigation services to run the missions. We introduce the key elements of our architecture, from the communication spectrum and technologies to the physical elements to place in deep space, going through the communication protocols with support of delay tolerant network (DTN), autonomous operation, and software defined networks (SDN). We then analyze the implications of such architecture on data delivery over the (Jupiter → Mars → Earth) path. We finally perform a preliminary performance evaluation of the architecture to support our proposal and display the evolution of the end-to-end latency at each milestone.",1557-959X,,10.1109/MAES.2019.2927897,Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; Academy of Finland; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8799061,,Space missions;Computer architecture;Satellites;Solar system;Orbits;Internet;Space exploration;Software defined networking,delay tolerant networks;Internet;protocols;radio spectrum management;software defined networking;space communication links,solar system;interplanetary Internet;evolutionary architecture;future space exploration missions;navigation services;communication spectrum;communication protocols;autonomous operation;software defined networks;IPN communication,,1,,29,Traditional,14-Aug-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Magazines
Delay-tolerant networking: an approach to interplanetary Internet,S. Burleigh; A. Hooke; L. Torgerson; K. Fall; V. Cerf; B. Durst; K. Scott; H. Weiss,"Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA; Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA; Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA",IEEE Communications Magazine,20-Jun-03,2003,41,6,128,136,"Increasingly, network applications must communicate with counterparts across disparate networking environments characterized by significantly different sets of physical and operational constraints; wide variations in transmission latency are particularly troublesome. The proposed Interplanetary Internet, which must encompass both terrestrial and interplanetary links, is an extreme case. An architecture based on a ""least common denominator"" protocol that can operate successfully and (where required) reliably in multiple disparate environments would simplify the development and deployment of such applications. The Internet protocols are ill suited for this purpose. We identify three fundamental principles that would underlie a delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and describe the main structural elements of that architecture, centered on a new end-to-end overlay network protocol called Bundling. We also examine Internet infrastructure adaptations that might yield comparable performance but conclude that the simplicity of the DTN architecture promises easier deployment and extension.",1558-1896,,10.1109/MCOM.2003.1204759,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1204759,,IP networks;Automatic repeat request;TCPIP;Delay;Wireless application protocol;Internet;Space technology;Relays;Wireless LAN;Buffer storage,Internet;transport protocols;delays;routing protocols,delay-tolerant networking;Internet;disparate networking environments;physical constraints;operational constraints;transmission latency;least common denominator protocol;structural elements;Bundling;DTN architecture,,998,5,10,,20-Jun-03,,,IEEE,IEEE Magazines

Interplanetary internet tested,E. Ackerman,NA,IEEE Spectrum,23-Jun-09,2009,46,7,13,14,"The many paths a message can take through the Internet make that network robust and efficient - and the envy of those whose job it is to design communications schemes for the far-flung spacecraft leaving Earth each year. After more than a decade of development, NASA is in a rush to have a communications network ready by 2011 that can efficiently carry data between Earth and the multiple probes, rovers, orbiters, and spacecraft exploring the solar system - effectively binding them together to form an interplanetary Internet.
